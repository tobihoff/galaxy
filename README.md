My program was developed according to the S.O.L.I.D principle, where I paid special attention to the fact that my functions are expandable as well as not to have unnecessary execution/steps/code lines. Each function has a single defined task. No unnecessary dependencies were installed. The code was maintained and refactored several times.

## Usage

```
Install dependencies:

npm install
npm init

To start some test:

1. run terminal
2. open the right path
3. run --> node src/index.js "symbols" (example: node src/index.js MMVI)
4. see results in the terminal
```

### Note

In the package.json you can find dependencies that are currently not used, but I would have used in the further process of the project, like parcel or jest.
